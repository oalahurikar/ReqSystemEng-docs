Burning pain points (plain English)
These are the problems teams feel every week when building complex products (robots, drones, vehicles, medical devices, etc.).
1) A small change breaks something far away
You change one spec (battery, motor, timing) and it silently breaks another part of the system.
You usually find out late (prototype/integration), when fixes are expensive.
2) “Impact analysis” is a meeting, not a button
When something changes, people ask: “What else does this touch?”
Today it’s a forensic process: spreadsheets, tribal knowledge, and days of meetings.
3) Requirements drift out of sync with reality
The document says one thing; the hardware/software does another.
Old decisions and downstream items don’t get updated, so teams build to conflicting truths.
4) Vague requirements cause arguments and rework
Words like fast, robust, safe, user‑friendly create endless interpretation.
Test teams can’t verify it cleanly, so you get late surprises and scope fights.
5) Tools create admin work, so engineers avoid them
If capturing a requirement feels like filling taxes, people write in docs/Slack and paste later.
The “system of record” becomes a graveyard—and audits become a scramble.
6) Context is hidden, so mistakes are easy
You can’t see the parent, child, related tests, and rationale in one place.
Teams spend time clicking around and still miss critical connections.
