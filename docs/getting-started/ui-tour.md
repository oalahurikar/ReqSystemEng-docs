# UI Tour

ReqDrivenDev uses a **split-screen layout** that separates the creative process from the committed truth.

## The Split Screen

### Left Side: The Draft (Sandpit)

The left side (40% of the screen) is your **thinking space**:

- **Chat Interface:** Type your requirements in natural language
- **Draft Cards:** The system generates draft requirements as you type
- **Refinement:** You can refine drafts before committing
- **No Risk:** Nothing here affects the database until you click "Add to Graph"

**Think of it as:** Your workspace where you experiment and refine ideas.

### Right Side: The Truth (Database)

The right side (60% of the screen) shows the **committed knowledge graph**:

- **Accepted Requirements:** All requirements that have passed validation
- **Current State:** The actual state of your requirements database
- **Data Table:** View and search all requirements
- **Manual Edits:** Minor tweaks can be made directly (with validation)

**Think of it as:** The official record that everyone sees.

## Why This Separation?

This "Draft vs. Truth" model prevents:

- **Accidental Commits:** You can't accidentally add bad requirements
- **Context Loss:** You see exactly what will be committed before it happens
- **Experimentation:** You can try different phrasings without polluting the database

## The Workflow

1. **Type** in the left side (Draft)
2. **Review** the draft card generated by the system
3. **Refine** if needed (the system maintains conversation history)
4. **Commit** by clicking "Add to Graph"
5. **See** the requirement appear in the right side (Truth)
